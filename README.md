# Car Wash Appointment Management System

This project, developed as a collaborative effort during my computer systems engineering academic training, involved creating a practical appointment management system for a real car wash service with an effective client. Serving as the culmination of my studies, this project provided invaluable hands-on experience across a range of technologies.

## Overview

The primary objective was to design and implement a comprehensive system to streamline appointment scheduling for customers and enhance operational management for car wash employees.

**Key Features:**

* **Customer Appointment Scheduling (Frontend):** An intuitive user interface built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** allowing customers to easily book car wash appointments.
* **Backend Management (Backend):** Robust backend functionality developed using **C#** and the **.NET Framework** for employees to:
    * Manage customer appointments (view, modify, cancel).
    * Handle inventory management.
    * Manage user profiles (employees).
    * Track business finances.
* **Database Management:** **SQL Server** was utilized for efficient and reliable storage and management of all application data.
* **Version Control & Collaboration:** **GitHub** was employed for version control, facilitating seamless collaboration and code integration among team members.
* **Development Environment:** **Visual Studio** served as the primary IDE, providing powerful tools for development, debugging, and deployment.
