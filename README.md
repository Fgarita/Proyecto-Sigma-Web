The project presented is a practical and applied implementation in a real environment with an effective client. It was developed as an integral part of the culmination of my academic training, in collaboration with fellow group members. The main objective of this project is the creation of an appointment management system for a car wash service. Its purpose is to allow users to schedule appointments efficiently. In addition, it enables the establishment's employees to manage customer appointments, as well as manage inventories, user profiles and keep track of the finances associated with the car wash business.
